# New_Years_Resolution_Application

## A fully functional New Years Resolution Checklist application written in Java.

This desktop application allows the user to check off goals they made for the new year. The application features a GUI with two windows, the list of goals and the history window that records and keeps track of completed goals. Whenever the user presses the "done" button that goal will be displayed in the history window, the user has an undo button as well if they made a mistake, this is also logged in the history window. The history window has two buttons "hide" minimizes the window and "clear" clears the previously logged data.

## Known Issues

- In this current version of the application the goals are hardcoded but this may change in the future, allowing the user to list whatever goals they would like directly from the application and not the source code.
